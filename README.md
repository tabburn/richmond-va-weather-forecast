# Richmond, Virginia Weather Forecast Using Ridge Regression
This analysis uses a unique [dataset](https://github.com/tabburn/richmond-va-weather-forecast/blob/main/resources/weather.csv) that was acquired from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search). I did my analysis for Richmond, Virginia near where I live, but you can pull a different dataset from the NOAA database for a local area near you.

## Summary
The purpose of this project is to predict tomorrow's temperature for Richmond, VA. We'll first clean the data and get it prepared for machine learning and then make a predictive model using ridge regression. After we find our first mean absolute error, we'll create more predictor variables with the goal of making more accurate predictions. Toward the end of the analysis we'll take a look at how often we fell into which percentage error rate and why. This data analysis answers questions like:

* What is tomorrow's temperature going to be?
* Does adding more predictor variables help lower the MAE?
* Why does our model have value counts of a higher MAE for certain periods of data and lower for others?
